# Write a program to calculate compounded interest using a while loop.
# The user inputs the amount deposited, the interest rate (as a percentage) per
# period, and the number of periods the deposit accumulates interest. Compound
# interest means that every period, your new balance is calculated using the
# last periodâ€™s balance times the interest rate.

# An example of compound interest would be:
# Lets say I have a bank account that gives me 1% of interest each month (I wish
# this existed), and I left 1000 soles in there for 3 months.

# In the first month I would get 1% of interest from the 1000 soles, that's 10
# soles. The total amount that I would have in the bank would change to S/1010

# For the second month, I get another 1% from the money that is in the account
# (S/ 1010), which would be about S/10.1. Now I would have in the bank S/1020.1.

# For the third month, I get another 1% from the money that is in the account
# (S/ 1020.1), which would be about S/10.2. Now I would have in the bank S/1030.3
